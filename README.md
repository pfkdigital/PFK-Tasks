### **Goal:**

Build a secure Todo application with role-based authentication using Spring Boot for the backend and Next.js for the frontend. The application will feature JWT authentication, OAuth2 for social login, role-based access control, email confirmation during registration, and comprehensive testing (unit, integration, E2E).

---

### **Core Features:**

1. **User Authentication and Role Management**
    - Register new users with a default `USER` role.
    - Implement email confirmation to verify user email addresses before allowing login.
    - Enable login functionality that issues a JWT token containing user roles.
    - Implement logout functionality to invalidate the JWT token.
    - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to protect API endpoints and features based on user roles (e.g., `ADMIN`, `USER`).
    - Allow admin users to manage user roles and access levels.
    - Implement a refresh token mechanism to maintain user sessions securely.
2. **OAuth2 Social Login**
    - Support OAuth2 login via providers like Google or GitHub.
    - Assign default `USER` role to users authenticated through OAuth2.
3. **Todo Management with Role-Based Access Control**
    - Implement CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) for todo items for regular users.
    - Allow admin users to view and manage todos for all users.
    - Ensure only authenticated users can access their own todos.
4. **Frontend Integration**
    - Develop a responsive and user-friendly interface using Next.js.
    - Implement role-based UI rendering to show/hide features based on user roles (e.g., admin panel only visible to admins).
    - Integrate with backend APIs for authentication, user management, and todo operations.
    - Implement error handling and user notifications for actions like failed login, missing permissions, etc.
5. **Comprehensive Testing**
    - **Backend Testing:** Create unit tests for services and controllers using JUnit and Mockito. Develop integration tests for API interactions and security configurations.
    - **Frontend Testing:** Write unit tests for React components and hooks using Jest and React Testing Library. Conduct integration tests to validate API calls and state management.
    - **End-to-End Testing:** Implement E2E tests using Cypress to cover user flows such as registration, email confirmation, login, role-based access, and todo management.
6. **Email Confirmation**
    - Generate a unique confirmation token when a user registers.
    - Send a confirmation email containing a link with the token.
    - Verify the token when the user clicks the confirmation link.
    - Activate the user account only after successful email confirmation.
    - Provide a feature to resend confirmation emails if the user requests it.

### **Learning Outcomes:**

1. **Understanding Full-Stack Development:**
    - Gain hands-on experience building a full-stack application with a Spring Boot backend and a Next.js frontend.
    - Learn how to structure a project with clear separation between backend and frontend responsibilities.
2. **Implementing Secure Authentication and Authorization:**
    - Learn to implement JWT-based authentication and how to secure API endpoints using Spring Security.
    - Understand how to use OAuth2 for social login and manage user roles.
    - Master role-based access control (RBAC) for securing different parts of the application based on user roles.
3. **Enhancing Security with Email Confirmation:**
    - Understand the process of sending and verifying email confirmations for user registration.
    - Learn to use JavaMailSender in Spring Boot for sending emails.
    - Gain insights into best practices for user account activation and email verification.
4. **Developing Robust User Interfaces:**
    - Build responsive and user-friendly UIs using Next.js and Tailwind CSS (or Material-UI).
    - Learn to integrate frontend components with backend APIs for seamless user experiences.
    - Master conditional rendering techniques based on user roles and authentication states.
5. **Testing and Quality Assurance:**
    - Develop unit tests for both backend and frontend components to ensure individual functionalities work correctly.
    - Write integration tests to verify interactions between different parts of the system.
    - Implement end-to-end (E2E) tests to simulate real user scenarios and validate overall application behavior.
6. **Deployment and Environment Configuration:**
    - Learn how to deploy backend services on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Azure.
    - Understand frontend deployment using platforms like Vercel or Netlify.
    - Manage environment variables for different deployment stages (development, testing, production).
